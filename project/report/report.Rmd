# Abstract

The project involves analyzing data about basketball players from the NBA
League in the 2015-2016 season. The motivating question of the analysis is: “In
the 2015-2016 season, how do the skills of a player relate to his salary?” We
argue that regardless of their positions, most players earn a salary which is
directly correlated with their skill levels. We observe players’ skill levels
by calculating each player’s EFF index using his basic individual statistics
during the season: points, rebounds, assists, steals, clocks, turnovers, and
shot attempts. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to assign weight for
each term in the original EFF formula. For the earned salaries during the
season, we reference the released data from Basketball Reference’s Salary
reports for individual players. (From analysis of EFF index and salary of
individual players, we indeed find that skill levels and salary have a direct
positive relationship among the players in the NBA League).

# Introduction

In any sports league, performance of a player during the season determines
his/her monetary value in the League and eventually determines his salary. In
this sense, it is important to understand how closely a player’s performance is
related to his salary. Analyzing this relationship provides an understanding of
how fairly and reasonably have the NBA teams have paid their players during the
2015-2016 season.

To measure each player’s performance during the season, we adopt in this paper,
the EFF or efficiency statistics, an index that is widely used to measure the
performance of NBA players. EFF is derived by a simple formula:
`EFF = (TP + TR + A + S + B – MFG – MFT – T) / GP`, where TP = total points,
TR = total rebounds, A = assists, S = steals, b = blocks, MFG = missed field
goals, MFT = missed free throws, T = turnovers, and GP = games played.

However, one of the issues with the EFF index is that it favors offense
oriented players over defense oriented players, as defense players have less
chance to score a goal, or catch a rebound compared to the offensive players.
To compensate for this drawback, we use a modified EFF that consider the
player’s positions. We utilize Principal Components Analysis (PCA) giving
weight for each term in the original EFF formula. 

The modified efficiency, EFF\*, is computed as:
`EFF* = (w1/s1)*x1 + … + (w8/s8)*x8`


We predict that this modified efficiency, EFF\* have direct positive
relationship with the salary that a player receives during the season. The
remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In [Data](#data) we briefly
discuss the data table, its structure, and each variable’s significance. In
[Methodology](#methodology) we describe how we obtained and cleaned our data
to fit our purpose of study and illustrates how we computed the modified
EFF\*. [Results](#results) investigates the relationship between performance
and salary from the perspective of the computed EFF\*. Finally, in
[Conclusions](#conclusions) we summarize our findings and point out any
outstanding trends.

# Data

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the pre-eminent men's professional
basketball league in North America, and is the premier men's professional
basketball league in the world. It has 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1
in Canada).
[citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association)

Basketball Reference.com provides professional basketball statistics updated
daily for every season. The site also includes sections for coaches, awards,
leaders, and the playoffs. It is one of the sites that is under Sports
Reference that provide both basic and sabermetric statistics and resources for
sports fans everywhere. 

From the raw data files of NBA players played in 2015-2016 season provided by 
Basket Reference, we have created a single csv file, “roster-salary-stats.csv”,
containing all variables from Roster, Totals, and Salary, with only one column
for the name of the player (the methodology of data acquisition and cleaning
will be discussed in the section that follows).

In the csv file, the table contain the following variables:
Player, Team, Number, Position, Height, Weight, Birth Date, Country,
Experience, College, Rank Totals (within the team), Age, Games, Games Started,
Minutes Played, Field Goals, Field Goal Attempts, Field Goal Percentage,
3-Point Field Goals, 3 Point Field Goal Attempts, 3 Point Field Goal
Percentage, 2 Point Field Goals, 2 Point Field Goal Attempts, 2 Point Field
Goal Percentage, Effective Field Goal Percentage, Free Throws, Free Throw
Attempts, Free Throw Percentage, Offensive Rebounds, Defensive Rebounds, Total
Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Turnovers, Personal Fouls, Points, Points,
Rank Salary (within the team), and Salary.

The data table combines three distinct data tables (roster, totals, and
salary) and is sorted by the player names. As the purpose of our study is to
investigate the relationship between performance and salary, the variables
that derive performance index and salary are critical. Among the variables
acquired from totals table, the critical variables to compute EFF index (the
performance index) are Total Points, Total Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks,
Field Goals, Field Goal Attempts, Free Throws, Free Throw Attempts, Games
(total # of games).  Also, the players’ positions, obtained from the roster
table, are also critical in that we later subset the player statistics dataset
by positions to calculate separate EFF indices for each position. Needless to
say, salary is the most important variable in our study. 

All data tables created in this project are in csv format while data summary
files are in txt format. 

# Methodology

## Data Acquisition

We obtained our data through webscraping in two phases. First, we accessed the
page with all team names and extracted the team abbreviations using the XPath
of the desired rows. Then, using the team abbreviations, we concatenated the
URL's to access and we did the following for each page:

1. Find the line containing the table ID we want (e.g. 'id="roster"').
2. Iterate through the lines following the previously found line until the
"</table>" closing tag is found.
3. Parse the table found between those two bounds (inclusive) into a data.frame
to be exported to a CSV file.
4. Repeat for other 2 tables we desire.

In this way, we were able to obtain all of our raw data to be process by our
cleaning script.

## Data Cleaning 

After acquiring the data from Basketball References, we have cleaned three
distinct data tables according to the following schema: 
* Roster table: contains basic information about players for each team (e.g
height, birth date, college,etc). We atempted to clean data in which each
element in same 
column obtains the same standard unit or expression. For example, in Experience
column, "R" means 0 year experience, so we converted R to 0 so that Experience
column contains integers only. Same procedure is applied for the rest. In
details, Player and College columns are kept as character. Country is
abbreviated in upper case, Height is in feet and Weight is in lbs. Birth Date
is in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format and all empty cells are considered as NA.  
* Stats table: contains all statistical performance data for each player. All
of the columns are numeric except for Player which is character. Again, empty
cells are filled with NA. 
* Salary table: contains the salary for each player. We converted the salary
columns from `$00000` to `000000`. 

After cleaning each table, we then merged the three distinct data tables-
roster, totals, salary- of each team and merge them using `merge()` which also
sorted them by the player names. We repeated this process for all teams and
combined all teams’ data using `rbind()`.
There were some players who appeared in multiple teams’ tables. For these
players, we have used “duplicated()” function to only acquire the data from
one team.  
Data cleaning produces a big data frame, called `roster-salary-stats.csv` which
contains roster, stats, salary information for all teams.

## EDA

### Sink'd Data 

For the aggregated dataset, we partitioned the columns into 2 groups:

1. Qualitative data, e.g. Position
2. Quantitative data, e.g. Steals

For the qualitative data, we used dplyr to determine the frequency of each
value and printed the resulting 2 column data.frame to `eda-output.txt`.

For the quantitative data, we used R's built-in `summary()` function to
generate most of the summary statistics. To get range, we simply subtract
`Min.` from `Max.` in the return value from `summary()` and added it to the
same result. This was then printed to the same output file, `eda-output.txt`.

### Plotted Data

## Data Analysis

From the cleaned, “roster-salary-stats.csv” file, first subset the data
according to the player’s position. Then add extra columns, Missed Free Throws
(=Free Throws-Free Throws Attempts), Missed Field Goals (=Field Goals – Field
Goal Attempts) and change the number of turnovers into a negative value to
match our EFF formula:
EFF = (total points + total rebounds + assists + steals + blocks – missed
field goals – missed free throws – turnovers) / (games played). 
From the subset of data table, select variables that are needed to compute
EFF. Eliminate the compounding variable, “number of games played” by dividing
each variable by the “number of games played”. 
Using “prcomp()”, compute PCA1 for each subset. Divide these weights with
standard deviation of each variable, re-expressing the weights. Multiply these
adjusted weights with each variable (now divided by the number of games). Sum
these together to obtain EFF\*.  

## ShinyApp

In order to better visualize and understand the data, we built two shiny apps.
The first, titled Salary Statistics by Team, displays a horizontal boxplot
that compares the different NBA Teams' salaries. The second, titled Statistic
Comparison for Players, presents a scatterplot comparing a range of variables
for individual players and displays the variables correlation.  These apps
serve as an approachable way to further analyze the data; the results of which,
will be discussed further in the rest of the report.
